# Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard

## Project Overview

The **Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard** is a web-based application designed to facilitate seamless remote collaboration. As virtual teamwork grows, this platform enables users to visually brainstorm and share ideas on a shared canvas in real time. This application is optimized for quick, casual use, allowing users to draw, write, and interact simultaneously, making it a valuable tool for distributed teams.

## Problem Statement

With the rise of remote work, there is a need for straightforward and efficient tools to support visual collaboration. Existing solutions are often complex or lack true real-time interactivity. This project fills that gap by providing a simple and accessible whiteboard with real-time capabilities.

## Objectives

- Develop an interactive, real-time whiteboard for multiple users.
- Ensure seamless collaboration, irrespective of user locations.
- Enable features like drawing, writing, saving, and session sharing.
- Optimize real-time synchronization across all connected users.

## Project Flow

1. **Canvas Interaction**: Users interact by drawing, adding text, or shapes on the shared canvas.
2. **Real-Time Synchronization**: Inputs are sent to the server and broadcast to all connected users.
3. **User Login & Session Management**: Users can create or join a board session after authentication.
4. **Save & Share**: Users can save their sessions or share access via a link.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot for server-side logic and real-time updates
- **Database**: MySQL (using JDBC for database connectivity)
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket implementation in Java
- **Deployment**: Apache Tomcat

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Security**: User authentication and data encryption were prioritized.
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive information is protected by design.
- **UI/UX Optimization**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging.
- **Scalability**: Database optimization ensures performance under heavy usage.
